# Be aware: do not use anything in this organization!
This organization has been created for the research documented [here](https://devopsjournal.io/blog/2022/09/18/Analysing-the-GitHub-marketplace) and holds mirrors of the original repositories. 
These might be outdated or disappear at any time! Therefor, you should not use them under no circumstance!

The repository names follow the pattern `<owner>_<repository>`, so if you want to find the original repo, follow it there.
